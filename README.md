Now for some explanation:

Those of you who have played Ultimate Tic Tac Toe can skip this section. So Tic Tac Toe, as most people know it, is a really boring game because it's an easily solvable game, even by people who have no mathematical or computing background, so you pretty much always tie unless the other person is just plain bad. There is a remedy, however, called Ultimate Tic Tac Toe. This game takes a normal Tic Tac Toe board, and replaces each of the squares with another Tic Tac Toe board--but it gets better. Your movement is controlled by your opponent, and your opponent's by you. Whichever smaller square you play on is the larger board that your opponent must play on. There is a good explanation of the rules here: https://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2013/06/16/ultimate-tic-tac-toe/

But even that isn't really good enough, is it? What if Ultimate Tic Tac Toe is too simple, or too small, for you? Well I have the solution. Now you can played an extremely generalized version. Imagine that normal Tic Tac Toe is 1-Depth Tic Tac Toe and Ultimate Tic Tac Toe is 2-Depth Tic Tac Toe. You can play Tic Tac Toe of any depth. For example, 3-Depth Tic Tac Toe means that, whenever you win a normal Tic Tac Toe board, you switch Ultimate Tic Tac Toe boards, and you need to win three Ultimate Tic Tac Toe boards in a row to win.

But wait--there's more! You can also play with multiple players (the rules are still the same), or you can play with weird boards, like a 4x4 board, a 5x5 board, or even a 3x5 board. The possibilities are endless. And that's pretty much it.
